Welcome to Rum Program!

This fun virtual bar invites guests to take a load off and enjoy a nice beverage.

The bartender will offer the menu to the guest.
The guest will look through the menu and select a drink.

If the guest has not already met the maximum drink limit (3),
the bartender will make their drink and update their tab.

Once the drink limit is met, or the guest declines another drink,
the bartender will close out their final tab.
